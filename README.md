🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)
This is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password based on multiple criteria:

Minimum length of 8 characters

At least one uppercase letter

At least one lowercase letter

At least one number

At least one special character

The script provides a score out of 5 and detailed feedback for weak passwords. It's interactive and runs in the terminal — type a password to test or enter exit to quit.
